# v2_dataset_tools
This small repo is meant to store scripts and utilities which work in conjunction with the v2 QCoDeS data set. These tools are Kouwenhoven lab specific and are therefore not (yet) in the main QCoDeS repo.  Furthermore, these tools use the new sweep functionality in QCoDeS which is as of yet (March 9 2018) only available in the following QCoDeS branch: https://github.com/sohailc/Qcodes/tree/sweep_integration . A PR to merge this functionality into QCoDeS master is being reviewed. 

Note: (wpfff)
I have merged the sweep_integration branch into the master branch of the kouwenhovenlab fork of Qcodes.
